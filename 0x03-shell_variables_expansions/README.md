# 0x03: Shell Variables and Expansions

This project focuses on understanding and manipulating **shell variables** and different types of **shell expansions** in Bash.

## Key Concepts Covered

* **Aliases:** Creating and using shortcut commands (`alias`).
* **Variables:** Defining, accessing, and substituting local and environmental variables.
* **Expansions:** Utilizing tilde (`~`), command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and parameter expansion (e.g., handling null or unset variables).
* **Quoting:** Using single and double quotes to control how the shell interprets special characters and expansions.
